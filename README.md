# Arithmetic: A Programmatic Approach

### Abstract
What is [linked](project.pdf) is a reformulation of the elementary parts of number theory and linear algebra in terms of a system procedures for achieving particular objectives, objectives like solving a particular system of linear equations. That these procedures have the potential to achieve their respective objectives is shown by their syntax in the same way that the syntax of the code fragment, "`if a=b and b=c, then verify that a=c`", shows the fragment's potential to work on different integer inputs.

### Usage Guide
The task of understanding the following procedures should be the same as that of understanding any codebase. Hence domain specific knowledge is required, which in this case comprises rational, formal polynomial, and matrix arithmetic as well as inequalities. Otherwise, running a debugger, that is, executing the following procedures step by step on some chosen input(s) and observing their control flows and sequences of program states should be equally helpful in making sense of them.
