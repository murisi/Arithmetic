### A Rigorous Proofless Approach to Linear Algebra

What is [linked](proofless.pdf) is an attempt to present linear algebra as a system of algorithms in a manner devoid of argumentation. The correctness of these algorithms hopefully is made apparent by stating expected variable values at certain points of execution. Mathematical argumentation is circumvented by letting algorithms *show* what a proposition in an argument might have *said*.
		
The subset of linear algebra I intend to tackle consists of the Smith normal form, determinants, compund matrices, general solutions to linear systems, characteristic matrices, the rational canonical form, block matrix multiplication, minimum polynomials, orthogonalization, and the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices. To get the above done, I also have to extract the algorithms from Sturm's theorem, Cauchy's bound, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the Euclidean division algorithm, and the factor theorem.
